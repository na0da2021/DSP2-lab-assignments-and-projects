## Overview
This repository includes 13 lab assignments covering various advanced topics in Digital Signal Processing (DSP). Each lab is designed to deepen our understanding of DSP concepts through practical implementation and experimentation using MATLAB.

## Lab Assignments
1. **Correlation Matrix**
   - Implementation of correlation matrices for signal analysis.
2. **Wiener Filter**
   - Implementation of Wiener filters to further usage in noise reduction and signal detection.
3. **Linear Prediction**
   - Techniques for linear prediction and their applications in signal processing.
4. **Steepest Descent**
   - Implementation of the steepest descent algorithm for optimization problems.
5. **Least Mean Squares (LMS)**
   - Adaptive filtering using the LMS algorithm.
6. **Noise Canceller**
   - Design and implementation of noise cancellation systems.
7. **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)**
   - Adaptive filtering using the RLS algorithm.
8. **Kalman Filter**
   - Implementation of Kalman filters for state estimation.
9. **Neural Network**
   - Application of neural networks in DSP.
10. **Uniform Quantizer**
    - Design and analysis of uniform quantizers.
11. **Non-Uniform Quantizer**
    - Design and analysis of non-uniform quantizers.
12. **Vector Quantizer**
    - Implementation of vector quantization techniques.
13. **Discrete Wavelet Transform**
    - Application of discrete wavelet transforms in signal processing.

## Getting Started
To get started with the lab assignments, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/na0da2021/DSP2-lab-assignments-and-projects]
2. **Navigate to the desired lab directory:**
   ```bash
   cd [lab-directory]   
3. **Open the MATLAB script for the lab assignment:**
   ```matlab
   open [lab-script.m]
4. **Run the script and follow the instructions provided in the comments.**

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2016a or later
- Basic understanding of DSP concepts

## Usage
Each lab directory contains:
- MATLAB scripts (`.m` files) for the lab assignment
- Sample data files (if applicable)

## Contributions
We welcome contributions to improve and expand the lab assignments. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Dr. Massoud El Ghonemi for his guidance and support throughout the course.
